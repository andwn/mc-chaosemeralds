## Chaos Emeralds Mod

### What

Hostile mobs drop power rings.

If you get hit, you drop all your rings.

Craft power rings by putting 4 gold ingots in a circle.

Craft a Chaos Emerald by putting 8 emeralds in a circle.

Use 7 chaos emeralds to go invincible.

A ring is consumed for each second you are invincible.

### Build

You can make an IDEA project like `gradlew.bat idea` or `./gradlew idea`.

There are probably equivalents for other IDEs.

To make a distributable jar: 

1. `gradlew.bat remapJar` or `./gradlew remapJar`
2. The jar should be in build/lib (use the one without `-dev`)
